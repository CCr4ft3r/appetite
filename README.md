<h5><strong>Have you ever thought that the hunger system of minecraft is too easy? Appetite can help you out.</strong></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<h4><b>💡<strong>About</strong></b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Appetite aims to make your survival experience more challenging - by forcing you to eat more food in relation to what you are doing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It adds <strong>time- and event-based rules </strong>that cause exhaustion&nbsp;to all players (excepts sleeping ones and players in creative/spectator mode).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Exhaustion is caused by breaking blocks, attacking entities, walking, fishing, climbing and so much more.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>✅ Exhaustion Rules&nbsp;</strong>(customizable &amp; deactivatable)</h4>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;⛏️🪓Exhaustion for breaking and placing blocks</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;🚶🏃Exhaustion for sneaking, walking, jumping and running</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;🪵🌱Exhaustion for tilling dirt, pathing dirt and stripping logs</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;🥶Exhaustion for freezing (when being inside powder snow)</p>
<p class="LC20lb MBeuO DKV0Md">🆕There are also rules for other mods - see paragraph "Compatibilities"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><b>📖 <strong>Getting Started</strong></b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can enable or disable the exhaustion rules and even tweak the amount of time and events after which exhaustion should be added to players.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I recommend <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/configured">Configured</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. There are 3 predefined profiles (difficulty levels) that you can choose from</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">PECKISH: Enables a few action- and event-based rules and adds a slight amount of additional exhaustion to vanilla.</li>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">HUNGRY (default profile): Adds moderate exhaustion by enabling a majority of rules.</li>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">STARVING: All exhaustion rules of interaction, movement and state are enabled to increase your appetite to a whole new level.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can either edit these profiles&nbsp;<strong>or you can create your own one</strong> by editing the custom profile. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4 class="LC20lb MBeuO DKV0Md"><strong>🧊Frozen Appetite</strong></h4>
<p class="LC20lb MBeuO DKV0Md">There might be some situations where it's inconvenient or challenging to have all that extra exhaustion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Therefore Appetite adds an effect that freezes the player's hunger and exhaustion: The 'Frozen Appetite Effect'.<br />During the effect time the player can do anything without being exhausted. Frozen Appetite is&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">caused by</span></p>
<ul>
<li>eating frozen food items (currently frozen fish) for 1 minute and</li>
<li>the homonymous potion for 2 minutes</li>
</ul>
<p>To get frozen food just drop the non frozen food item into a cold biome and wait a minute. Frozen food can also be melted in the same way but in a warm biome.</p>
<p><strong>But watch out!&nbsp;</strong>Overconsuming froozen food causes unwanted side effects - just like in real life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4 class="LC20lb MBeuO DKV0Md">🔌<strong>Compatibilities</strong></h4>
<p>&nbsp;Appetite also add exhaustion for other mods -&nbsp;all supported mods are optional&nbsp;dependencies so you can choose which one you want to use or none at all.</p>

<h4><b>❗<strong>Important Notes</strong></b></h4>
<ul>
<li>Time-based rules increase exhaustion <strong>gradually</strong> - hence the rule also applies, but only proportionally, if you walk less than the defined time.</li>
<li>Rules <strong>consider</strong> the <a href="https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Hunger#Exhaustion_level_increase">vanilla exhaustion increase</a>. Meaning that "80" for the jumping rule decreases the food bar value exactly after 80 jumps.</li>
<li>It's <strong>recommended</strong> to use Appetite in combination with <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/appleskin">AppleSkin</a> and mods that add food/crops in general to minecraft.</li>
<li>Appetite&nbsp;<strong>does not&nbsp;</strong>work in peaceful mode</li>
</ul>

<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">🔨</span><strong><b>ModLoader</b></strong></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Appetite is currently only available for Forge - sorry. Maybe this will change in the future.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><b>📝<strong>FAQ</strong></b></h4>
<div class="spoiler">
<p><strong><b>Q: Can I use Appetite in my modpack?</b></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A: Yes -&nbsp; Feel free to include Appetite into your modpack - Remember to give credit and don't claim Appetite as your own creation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><b>Q: Which Minecraft versions are supported?</b></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A: Appetite is currently available for </span><b>1.18.2</b> <b>and 1.19.2.</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Q: Are there any known incompatibilities with other mods?</strong></p>
<p>A: Not yet - most mods like "Tough as Nails" &amp; "Survive" are compatible with Appetite - as long as they don't set player exhaustion to an internal used value. If the mod you want to use, also add player exhaustion (like "Survive" do), you have to take this into account when setting the values for Appetite's exhaustion rules.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><b>Q: Are you going to backport Appetite to versions before 1.18.2?</b></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A: Probably not - There are some great mods for 1.12.2 and 1.16.5 that tweak the hunger mechanics. But if you have good reasons go ahead and try to convince me😉</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><b>Q: Can you add this feature&nbsp; ...?</b></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A: Sure - if it matches the concept of Appetite. Feel free to create a feature request in the GitHub repository.</span></p>
