<h5><strong>Have you ever thought that the hunger system of minecraft is to easy? Appetite can help you out.</strong></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<h4><b>💡<strong>About</strong></b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Appetite aims to make your survival experience more challenging - by forcing you to eat more food in relation to what you are doing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It adds <strong>time- and event-based exhaustion rules</strong> for all joined players (excepts sleeping players or players in creative and spectator mode).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additional exhaustion is caused by breaking blocks, attacking entities, walking, fishing, climbing and so much more.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>✅ Exhaustion Rules&nbsp;</strong>(customiziable &amp; deactivatable)</h4>

<h4><b>📖 <strong>Getting Started</strong></b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everything is highly customizable to match your preferences. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can enable or disable the exhaustion rules and even tweak the amount of time and events after which exhaustion should be added to players.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are 3 predefined profiles (difficulty levels) that you can choose from</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">PECKISH: Enables a few action- and event-based rules and adds a slight amount of additional exhaustion to vanilla.</li>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">HUNGRY: Adds moderate exhaustion by enabling a majority of rules.</li>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">STARVING: All exhaustion rules of interaction, movement and state are enabled to increase your appetite to a whole new level.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can either edit these profiles directly (in the folder config/appetite) <strong>or you can create your own one</strong> by editing the custom profile. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The main config specifies which profile should be used.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><b>❗<strong>Important Notes</strong></b></h4>
<ul>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">Appetite <strong style="font-size: 1.2rem;"><b>does not</b></strong><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;"> change or prevent the already added exhaustion by vanilla.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Time-based rules increase exhaustion <strong>gradually</strong> - the rule even applies (but only proportionate) if, e.g., you walk less than the defined time.</span></li>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">Appetite is required on both sides (client and server)</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">🔨</span><strong><b>ModLoader</b></strong></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Appetite is currently only available for Forge - sorry. Maybe in the future that will change.</span></p>
